# Air Quality → Policy Gap Dashboard
## What this project does

This repository builds a city-level winter air quality index for Delhi using CPCB reference monitors via OpenAQ and compares it against India’s emergency pollution policies (GRAP).

It shows whether short-term regulatory actions actually reduce population exposure during Delhi’s worst smog season.

## What’s inside

- `data/raw/` — Hourly PM2.5 from four CPCB stations (Aya Nagar, Anand Lok, Greater Kailash, Vasundhara)
- `data/processed/` — Daily Delhi-level PM2.5 index (Nov 2025)
- `policy/` — GRAP stages and regulatory actions
- `outputs/` — Policy summaries and charts showing the policy gap
