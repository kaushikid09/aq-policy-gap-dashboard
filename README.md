# Air Quality → Policy Gap Dashboard

This project links air quality monitoring data (PM2.5, PM10) with environmental policy interventions in India to assess whether policies are producing measurable changes in pollution.

The goal is not to “prove” causality, but to provide decision-makers with structured evidence on:
- When interventions happened
- What pollution levels did before and after
- Where policy gaps may exist

## Why this matters

India has hundreds of air quality monitoring stations and dozens of pollution control measures (GRAP, crop burning restrictions, clean cooking schemes, etc.), but these are rarely analysed together.

This project turns raw monitoring into **policy-usable intelligence**.

## What this will include

- Daily PM2.5 and PM10 trends from OpenAQ
- Crop burning proxies from NASA FIRMS
- Government intervention timelines (GRAP, directives, bans)
- Before/after and time-series analysis
- A public dashboard for policymakers and researchers

## Status

This repository is under active development.
