# Delhi Winter Air Quality Snapshot — November 2025

**Data source:** CPCB reference monitors via OpenAQ  
**Stations used:** Aya Nagar, Anand Lok, Greater Kailash, Sector-5 Vasundhara  
**Period covered:** November 2025 (34 days including early December spillover)

## What did Delhi residents breathe?

Daily PM2.5 across Delhi was calculated by averaging hourly readings across four CPCB reference stations.

This produces a city-level exposure curve rather than a single-station reading.

## Key findings

Based on the Delhi-level daily PM2.5 index:

- **There were no clean-air days in November 2025.**
- Every day exceeded India’s legal 24-hour PM2.5 limit of **60 µg/m³**.
- Every day exceeded the WHO’s health guideline of **15 µg/m³**.
- Multiple multi-day stretches crossed into **“severe” pollution (>250 µg/m³)**.

This indicates **chronic winter exposure**, not short-term spikes.

## Why this matters for policy

Most emergency measures (GRAP stages, advisories, closures) are designed to respond to short pollution episodes.

The November 2025 data instead shows:

> Delhi experienced **persistent toxic air** across the entire winter period.

This suggests that:
- Emergency measures may be too short or too weak,
- Structural winter emissions (biomass burning, heating, inversion effects) dominate exposure,
- Health risks accumulate continuously rather than episodically.

## What this dashboard will test next

This dataset will be overlaid with:
- GRAP stage changes
- Fire and crop-burning periods
- Festival and traffic shocks

to evaluate whether any policy interventions produced measurable relief in PM2.5 levels.
